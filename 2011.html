The final dish is in the shape of a crescent. Traditional ones are only stuffed with tomato and mozarella. Many confuse it with another similar dish, the Stromboli, but it differs in that the sauce is served as a side, while in the Stromboli it is present in the dish. Fried versions also exist. It is often sold at lunch counters in Italy due to its sandwich like shape and size.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q7 </strong>The Iliupersis, also known as The Sack of Troy, is a lost epic of ancient Greek literature. It was one of the Epic Cycle, that is, the "Trojan" cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The Iliou persis was probably composed in the seventh century BCE. Only ten lines of the original text of the Iliou persis survive. For its storyline we are almost entirely dependent on a summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the Chrestomathy written by an unknown "Proclus”.</p>
                    <p>By most accounts, including those of Pliny the Elder and Cassius Dio, the Iliupersis was among the most popular performance pieces for many centuries after its original composition. There are even reports of it being performed by bards in Shakesperean England. Such was the popularity of the work that it has passed on into todays language by means of a popular turn of phrase. The phrase itself is a distortion of the truth compounded by urban legend, but the truth involves the Iliupersis.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q8 </strong>Andre Kasongo Ilunga (born 20 October 1972) is the Vice-President of the UNAFEC party and Minister for Foreign Trade of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
                    <p>Under government rules, a party must provide a shortlist of at least two candidates for any ministerial role, with the Prime Minister making the final choice from the list. The only two candidates put forward for the Foreign Trade post were Kasongo Ilunga and Kisimba Ngoy. Kisimba had been a vocal supporter of Mobutu Sese Seko, someone who Antoine Gizenga had once strongly opposed, likely causing him to choose the unknown Ilunga over Kisimba.</p>
                    <p>The enigmatic 36-year-old failed to appear at the opening of the new government, and he hasn’t claimed his office. Some say that the invisible bureaucrat has resigned, but the prime minister insists that he must do so in person. Question is, why did he decline to claim his office?</p>
